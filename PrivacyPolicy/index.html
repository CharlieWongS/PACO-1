  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: May 31, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how PACO: Auto handles your information. Our app respects your privacy and only collects the minimum necessary data to function.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>PACO: Auto does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. The app uses your device's location services (via Apple MapKit and Core Location) to allow you to save and view your parking locations. This data is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li>Not transmitted to any server.</li>
    <li>Only used to display your parking history within the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app requests permission to access your location (Precise Location) while the app is in use or running in the background (if enabled), so it can record where you parked. You can change location permissions at any time in your device settings.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app does not knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with data, please contact us and we will delete the information.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Since your data remains on your device, we rely on your operating system’s security features. We do not store, transmit, or share your data externally.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app uses Apple MapKit to provide map features. MapKit may collect anonymized usage data as governed by Apple’s privacy policies. Please refer to <u><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a></u> for more details.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app or on this page, with the “Last updated” date revised accordingly.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us:</p>
